# HuggingFace Model Generator

This project provides a simple tool for generating model code for the Swarms library from Hugging Face model URLs.

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to `addnew_model.py`
2. Update the Hugging Face model URL
3. Add your OpenAI API key
4. Run the script

## Example Output

- Generated model code: `newmodel.py`
- Scraped model information: `model_content.txt`

## Current Limitations

The current implementation is a proof of concept and has several areas for improvement.

## TODO

1. Enhance web scraping functionality
2. Implement standard boilerplate code for models
3. Refactor and optimize existing codebase
4. Develop more sophisticated prompts for code generation
5. Implement comprehensive testing suite for generated code
